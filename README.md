Module 3 Challenge 

## The Task
This project features refactoring given code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JSS code that I wrote. It will be clean, polished and have a responsive user interface that adpts to multiple screen sizes. 

## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Critiera
The user needs a new, secure password
When they click the button to generate a password
Then they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
When prompted for password criteria
They will be given options to select which criteria to include in the password
The first option begins with the length of the password
The user is asked to choose a length of at least 8 and no more than 128 characters
Next they are asked different character types to include in the password
They are asked to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
When the user answers each prompt
Then their input will be validated and at least one character type will be selected
When the user answers all prompts
Then a password will be generated matching the selected criteria
The password will be written on the page in the textbox
